This is the code and data accompanying the paper: Street Tree Stress Levels Vary with Tree Species, Tree Size, and Urban Conditions in Two U.S. Cities

The files are organized as follows;

01Data: Includes data collected for each city and quality control (QAQC) data
* Chicago: 
	Has raw datasheets and the combined data used in analysis (NOTE: the raw data include minor spelling errors and other issues corrected in the code). 
	UIC data (from a nearby university) was not used in final analyses but is kept here for reference. 
	Otherwise, files are labeled as to whether they include the tree health data, the growing condition data, or both. 
	Information from Dirr's Encyclopedia of trees and shrubs for Chicago species also included
* Durham:
	Analogous to Chicago, has raw datasheets and combined data use in analysis. Be aware that the raw data can include minor spelling errors corrected in the code

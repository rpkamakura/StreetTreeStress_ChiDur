	University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) data (a nearby university) were not used in final analyses but are kept here for reference. 
	Otherwise, files are labeled as to whether they include the tree health data, the growing condition data, or both. 
	Information from Dirr's Encyclopedia of trees and shrubs for Chicago species also included
* Durham:
	Analogous to Chicago, has raw datasheets and combined data use in analysis. Be aware that the raw data can include minor spelling errors corrected in the code
